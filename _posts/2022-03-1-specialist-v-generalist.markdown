# Generalist v Specialists #


I am a definite generalist - is this a good idea?

In many fields it is best to be a specialist. The scarce expertise which is in demand can command high wages and a guarantee of future work and career development. But what happens when the specialism is in a declining area or where it has a shelf-life?

In some fields, like technology and also in management consultancy, methodologies and tools are constantly being changed and/or improved. In this case, the individuals who can command the higher wages and future work are those that are able to continually learn. They are constantly updating their knowledge portfolio and testing / evaluating the new approaches.

My interests cover many disciplines: technology, behavioural science (nudge), design thinking as well as operating model and Lean. Having many ‘strings to my bow’ provides me the opportunity to bring learnings from one field into another. Knowing design thinking changes the way I run an operational improvement workshop.

To keep on top of my field, I read about the subjects, attend training courses and vendor webinars. I try to make this part of my own personal operating system. I never really set out to be a generalist though - I guess I’m just curious.

In my field that is a benefit.

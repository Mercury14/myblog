## CO2 in the Food Packaging - Why I was missing the bigger issue

“What, wait, they put CO2 into food packaging to make it last longer! But isn’t that a greenhouse gas which is contributing to climate change?”. That was my reaction this week following the news stories in the UK about a shortage of CO2. 

When two fertiliser plants in the UK, operated by CF Industries, halted production due to the spike in energy costs, they also stopped producing 60% the UK’s food grade CO2 for food and drink producers [link](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/explainers-58626935). I wondered why the greenhouse gas CO2 was being used in this way. Surely it's a bad thing right? Well the answer seems to be not necessarily.

Robust packaging and the use of CO2 in food products avoids food waste, which currently contributes between 6%and 8% to global greenhouse gas emissions. To put that in context, in 2020 India is estimated to have contributed 7%.

Even though food production accounts for 26% of global greenhouse gas emissions (1), the contribution of greenhouse gases within the supply chain (packaging, transport etc) only contributes 4.7% (18% of 26%). Removing CO2, from packaging would significantly increase the amount food waste as food starts to spoil.

The really useful ‘Our World in Data’ website says, “Reducing emissions from food production will be one of our greatest challenges in the coming decades. Unlike many aspects of energy production where viable opportunities for upscaling low-carbon energy –  renewable or nuclear energy –  are available, the ways in which we can decarbonise agriculture are less clear. We need inputs such as fertilisers to meet growing food demands, and we can’t stop cattle from producing methane. We will need a menu of solutions: changes to diets; food waste reduction; improvements in agricultural efficiency; and technologies that make low-carbon food alternatives scalable and affordable. “

Prioritising the biggest impact an individual can make (in regarding food production) is actually to eat less meat - even a day a week. It has a bigger impact than shopping locally and not only reduces greenhouse gases, but reduces pressure on land-use (beef produced in South America is contributing to deforestation) and water use and pollution.

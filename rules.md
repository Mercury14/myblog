## Rules and Learnings that I try to live by
I have seen others put up their version of lessons they have learned - here is mine.

* Work as hard for yourself as you do for others
* Don’t put things off until tomorrow or the next day because you think you will have more energy, you work better under pressure or you will feel more like doing it – you don’t and you won’t (Lies we tell ourselves)
* Focus on developing Virtus (Wisdom, Courage, Justice and Self Control) 
* Take the opportunities to practice self-control – food tastes better when you are hungry (Socrates)
* People depend on you – including your future self, so don’t let them down. Check in with your future self regularly and be held to account
* Accept whatever life / fate throws at you cheerfully and coolly
* Try and control only what can be controlled
* You are physically evolved for endurance, to eat a mainly vegetarian diet with occasional shortages – the abundance provided by modern life is against your nature and if you are not careful will make you fat, weak and sick
* If you want to achieve more than the crowd, you need to think and behave differently from the crowd
* You have had original ideas that if executed effectively could have created million pound businesses – don’t doubt yourself and follow through
* Planning is important (failing to plan is planning to fail), but don’t confuse planning with action
* Focus on one thing at a time – you will do a better job and overall it takes less mental energy (so less feeling frazzled)
* Speak up and front up – courage
* Build up positive rituals – one by one. When you fall off the wagon, as you will occasionally, immediately get back on (don’t wait until Monday to reset – do it now)
* Make time to connect with people, especially those really important few
* Run often – it’s good for you and you enjoy it once you get out
* Practice active listening – give people your whole attention
* Look around – observe and be curious, be present and mindful
* If you are looking to make a change, start today – not Monday!! 
* If you want to be stronger, then be stronger. If you to run further, then run further…
* Ensure you have a rationale for every investment, spending (or betting) decision.
* Turn up - Lost days hurt you more than good days help
* Put in place measures that guide – tracking keeps you honest. Maintain the unbroken chain.
